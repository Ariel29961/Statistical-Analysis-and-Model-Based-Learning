    "You can use the ``scipy.stats`` package *only* to illustrate PDFs. You should illustrate histograms with number of bins about 5%-10% of the number of samples $n=1,000$ in the input to the histogram. For example, use $100$ bins equally spaced between the range of the samples, so that you'll get a nice comparison between the empirical distribution and the theoretical distribution represented by the PDF. Make sure that the histogram is normalized to approximate the density of the simulated random variable. Set the seed ``random.seed(my_id)`` where ``my_id`` is your ID number with leading zeros removed. \n",
